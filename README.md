# Name's Wright!

## Who the fuck are you?
I'm a 17 year old artist, aspiring programmer and content creator.

## Stuff that I'm currently working on
The Burden We Carry - Wonderland-themed horror game inspired by games like Corpse Party etc.
The Purgatory (CANCELLED) - Basically Outlast Trials but on ROBLOX
Content Creation - As always, mainly creepy source related content, but I also talk about games like Silent Hill.

## Stuff I play!
Apex Legends
Dead By Daylight
Zenless Zone Zero
Honkai Impact 3rd
The Outlast Trials

## IRL Hobbies and interests
I love history!
I'm obsessed with guns!
Lucid dreaming!
Running!
Hanging out, drinking coffee!
Going out in the rain!

## What to expect from me?
I used to be...weird. As in, very confused about life, but I'm nowhere near being a bad person ever again.
I'm almost always active because I have literally nothing to do
I'm not really good in talking to help, but I'm a great listener if you need to let off some steam!
I try to be very kind but I may SOMETIMES come off as rude despite not wanting to


## That's all! Hope we get along!
